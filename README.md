# Brown University Building Recognition System

## Overview
We aimed to create a program that can take in an image of signage on a modern day building on Brown’s campus and have it output images of that area prior to Brown’s demolition of those historic buildings. First, we needed to build a dataset of images of historical buildings, and a set of images of signage on those buildings. Then, we utilized optical character recognition (OCR) to identify the building to match it with the corresponding historical images.

## Running the Model
To run each test, you must add the image paths you are running the tests on (e.g.
  ```
    python3 main.py -i ./data/new/Wellness/Sternlicht1.jpg
  ```
